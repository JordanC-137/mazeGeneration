# Algorithmically Generated Maze

This Python code uses Prim's Algorithm to algorithmically generate a Perfect Maze.

**Perfect Maze**: A maze where any two cells can be joined by a unique path.


## How do we achieve a Perfect Maze
To achieve this quality of maze; I resorted to implementing Prim's Algorithm. This algorithm, documented in this baeldung article, connects each cell of the graph. The algorithm iteratively picks the lowest-weight connection that links a new-node to the set of visited nodes.

## Explanation of the code

## Intentions of this project
This project was written with the intention of challenging myself in my Pythonic and algorithmic ability. It has been an enjoyable experience featuring multiple left turns and major changes in approach.

I would recommend this project idea to those curious about sharpening their already capable skills, while avoiding the cliche of independantly building a game.
